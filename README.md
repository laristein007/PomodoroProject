This is my first attempt at making a java program that I can actually use. A pomodoro timer.
The UI is inspired by cyber elements, as I find that type of design appealing.

This was built while referencing YouTube videos (BroCode: clock, timer).
It is still a work in progress as I intend to expand of the features it has.
